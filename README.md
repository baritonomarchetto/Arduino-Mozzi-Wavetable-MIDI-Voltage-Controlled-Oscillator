# About this repository
This repo contains two wavetable oscillators projects, an older one stored in "VERSION_1_(OLD)" folder and a new one. The older one was a PCB-only project still here for the sake of "good ol' memories". It has not been updated for years and I am not planning to update or support it in any way in the future.
Here it is a link to an article I wrote about this very first oscillator project (Instructables): https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Voltage-Controlled-Wavetable-Oscillator/

It is a better idea to refer to the new one, if you ask me :)

# Dual Wavetable Voltage Controlled Oscillator
A dual wavetable voltage controlled oscillator eurorack module based on Mozzi library.
